UPGRADE FROM 6.4 to 7.0
=======================

Symfony 6.4 and Symfony 7.0 will be released simultaneously at the end of November 2023. According to the Symfony
release process, both versions will have the same features, but Symfony 7.0 won't include any deprecated features.
To upgrade, make sure to resolve all deprecation notices.

This file will be updated on the [7.0 branch](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/7.0/UPGRADE-7.0.md) for each
deprecated feature that is removed.
